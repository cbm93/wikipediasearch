# Wikipedia Search

This project was created with HTML, CSS & Javascript

# How does it work?

This repo contains a simplistic Wikipedia application that allows you to search articles that was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON. It works by using the Wikipedia API to pull information which has been searched for. It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap grid system. The website is static and easy to use. All you have to do is search and it populates articles.
